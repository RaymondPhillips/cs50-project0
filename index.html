            <p>
                My name is Raymond Phillips. I am a risinng sophomore at Rutgers University studying computer science. I was born and raised in India for the first part of my childhood. For the second part of my upbringing I have lived in the united states moving around
                different states and finally settling in Bridgewater, New Jersey.

            <p>
                I love mechanical keyboards. I am looking to build my own keyboard in the near future and I am thinking about going with a 60% or 65% layout. I am not sure about the case but for the switches I am thinking about the holy pands or the purple zealios v2's.
                I am not sure about wheter I should go with lubed switches or unlubed switches as that is a bit of extra work and it may be time consuming.

            <h1> Goals</h1>
            <p>
                For long term goals, I wish to obtain a master degree in either cyber security or basic computer science and I want my portfolio to reach at least $1 million evaluation before I turn 25. For the short term I would like to finish Kingdom come deliverance
                and stardew valley. I have been putting those games off for a while and have been juggling doing this project or trying to complete those games.

            <p>
                I do not have much to add here as I did not keep track of things I have done in the past. I want to say that I have completed the SFDC admin trianing and certification aswell as the aws certficiation but that is yet to be determined. In high school I
                did not do much or participate in a lot of activities so I do not have anything to show case from that era, however I plan to change that in the future. I want take a greater part in soceity and not just sit back.
